            <h1>Barcelona</h1>
            <p>At the age of 16 years, four months, and 23 days old, Messi made his first-team debut as a 75th-minute substitute during a friendly against Porto on 16 November 2003.[34][42] Under Frank Rijkaard, who promoted him to the first team in October 2004,[43] he made his league debut on 16 October 2004 against Espanyol,[34] and scored his first senior goal on 1 May 2005 against Albacete, from an assist by Ronaldinho, becoming at that time the youngest-ever scorer for the club.[44][45] At 17 years, three months, and 22 days old, he was at the time the youngest player to represent Barcelona in an official competition.[46] Messi won the league title in the 2004–05,[47] and 2005–06 season. He won his first Champions League trophy in the 2006 final, although he was ruled out injured.[48][49] On 10 March 2007, Messi scored his first hat-trick in a Clásico, the first player to do so in 12 years, equalising after each goal by Real Madrid to end the match in a 3–3 draw in injury time.[50] In Rijkaard's final years at the club, Barcelona finished the 2006–07, and 2007–08 season without trophies,[51][52] leading to his departure. Messi was given the number 10 shirt for the 2008–09 season.[53] During that season, Messi, alongside Samuel Eto'o and Thierry Henry, contributed to a total of 100 goals in all competitions, a record at the time for the club.</p>

                On 29 November, having scored 40 goals at club and international level for the calendar year and helped Argentina win the 2021 Copa América, Messi received a record seventh Ballon d'Or.[93] He finished his debut season with PSG with 11 goals and 14 assists across all competitions.[94]

            <h1>International career</h1>
            <p>Despite his dual citizenship and professional success in Spain, Messi’s ties with his homeland remained strong, and he was a key member of various Argentine national teams from 2005. He played on Argentina’s victorious 2005 FIFA World Youth Championship squad, represented the country in the 2006 World Cup, and scored two goals in five matches as Argentina swept to the gold medal at the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games. Messi helped Argentina reach the 2010 World Cup quarterfinals, where the team was eliminated by Germany for the second consecutive time in World Cup play. At the 2014 World Cup, Messi put on a dazzling display, scoring four goals and almost single-handedly propelling an offense-deficient Argentina team through the group stage and into the knockout rounds, where Argentina then advanced to the World Cup final for the first time in 24 years. Argentina lost that contest 1–0 to Germany, but Messi nevertheless won the Golden Ball award as the tournament’s best player. During the 2016 Copa América Centenario tournament, he netted his 55th international goal to break Gabriel Batistuta’s Argentine scoring record.</p>
