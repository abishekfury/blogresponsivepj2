            <p>He was born in Mogi das Cruzes, São Paulo, to Neymar Santos Sr. and Nadine da Silva and had a Christian upbringing.[19][20] He inherited his name from his father, who is a former footballer and became his son's advisor as Neymar's talents began to grow.[21] Neymar comments on his father's role: "My father has been by my side since I was little. He takes care of things, my finances and my family."[22] Growing up, Neymar combined his love of futsal with street football.[23] Neymar said that futsal had a massive influence on him growing up, helping him develop his technique, speed of thought and ability to perform moves in tight spaces.[24]

                In 2003, Neymar moved with his family to São Vicente, where he began playing for youth side Portuguesa Santista.[25] Then, later in 2003, they moved to Santos, where Neymar joined Santos.[26] With the success of his youth career and added income, the family bought their first property, a house next to Vila Belmiro, Santos' home stadium. Their quality of family life improved, as at age 15, Neymar was earning 10,000 reais per month and at 16, 125,000 reais per month. At 17, he signed his first full professional contract, was upgraded to the Santos first team, and began signing his first sponsorship deals.[27] </p>

            <p>So, Neymar and his sister, Rafaella, received scholarships to the private school. practice, except one, that was when his teammates stopped complaining about him missing every practice, due to his evolvement of his ability with the ball. His school days did not last too long.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="text5">
            <h1>Personal Particulars </h1>
            <p>He has a very close sibling relationship with his sister Rafaella Beckran, and honoured her by tattooing her face on his arm, while Beckran tattooed her brother's eyes on her arm.[386] Neymar is the father of three children, each with different women. Including one son born in 2011 and two daughters, born in 2023 and 2024, respectively.[387]

                Neymar is a Christian,[19][20] and follows the Pentecostal branch of the religion.[388] Neymar has spoken about his faith saying: "Life only makes sense when our highest ideal is to serve Christ!"[389] Additionally, he has sometimes worn a headband with the words "100% Jesus".[390] Neymar reportedly also tithes (10%) his income to his church and has named Kaká as his religious role model.[391] Each year, Neymar organises a charity match with fellow Brazilian footballer Nenê in Nenê's hometown of Jundiaí, with the purpose of raising food for needy families.[392] In addition to his native Portuguese, Neymar also speaks Spanish.[393][394]
                
                In July 2019, police announced that a rape investigation against Neymar would be dropped due to insufficient evidence.[395] On 2 September 2020, it was reported that Neymar, along with PSG teammates Ángel Di María and Leandro Paredes, tested positive for COVID-19. The French sports newspaper L'Équipe said that the three players reportedly went on vacation in Ibiza. As a result, they were quarantined for one week, and the rest of the players and working staff were scheduled to take a coronavirus test within the same week</p>

            <h1>Santos </h1>
            <p>Neymar began playing football at an early age and he was soon spotted by Santos who offered him a contract in 2003; where he was inducted into their youth academy, which has, in the past, produced Brazilian internationals like Coutinho, Clodoaldo, Diego, Elano and Alex. He also joined the likes of Pepe, Pelé and Robinho in starting out his career at the club, nicknamed Peixe.[28] While in the youth academy, Neymar met Paulo Henrique Ganso, becoming good friends in the process. Aged 14, Neymar travelled to Spain for try outs with the Real Madrid youth team. He did not stay in Madrid, however, as his father decided at the time that he preferred the young prodigy to keep growing up while playing at Santos</p>

            <div class="text8">
            <h1>Barcelona </h1>
            <p>On 24 May 2013, Santos announced that they had received two offers for Neymar. The following day, Neymar announced he would sign with Barcelona on 27 May and join the team after playing in the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup. Neither Neymar nor the clubs released details on the transfer fee or personal terms, save to say he signed a five-year deal.[75] On 3 June, Neymar was unveiled by Barcelona after passing medical tests and signing a contract that would keep him at the club through June 2018.[76]

                Neymar was presented at the Camp Nou in front of 56,500 fans, a record turnout for a Brazilian player.[77] Club vice-president Josep Maria Bartomeu initially said Neymar's transfer fee was €57.1 million and his release clause set at €190 million.[78][79] Barcelona's doctor suggested he might need to gain weight to be able to cope physically in Spanish football.</p>

            <div class="text9">
            <h1>Paris Saint-Germain</h1>
            <p>On 3 August 2017, Barcelona announced that Neymar's legal representatives made a payment of €222 million[133] to the club, equal to the release clause of his contract, which constituted the most expensive transfer ever. The club informed UEFA so that they can determine any disciplinary responsibilities that may arise from this case.[13] According to the BBC, in Spain, the release clause must be activated by the footballer himself. The situation was unusual, in that the fee was paid to the club directly, after La Liga had refused to receive the payment.[134][14] Usually, the buyout clause is deposited with La Liga in order to release the player from his contract, and the league then passes the money to the selling club. However, La Liga rejected the payment—citing violation of Financial Fair Play (FFP) rules by PSG, who are backed by money from Gulf state Qatar.[135]

                Neymar joined PSG on a contract that would run until 2022.[136] He was offered the number 10 shirt by Javier Pastore as a "welcome gift".[137][138] It was believed that PSG signed Neymar to increase their chances of winning the Champions League.[139]</p>

            <h1>Al Hilal</h1>
            <p>On 15 August 2023, Neymar completed a transfer to Saudi Pro League club Al Hilal on a two-year contract.[224][225] The transfer fee was reported to be worth €90 million, making him the most expensive purchase in the Saudi Pro League.[225] He is also reportedly being paid €150m a year at Al Hilal, six times the amount he earned at PSG.[226]

                According to The Independent, Barcelona were the only European club who showed genuine interest in signing Neymar; other top clubs turned away primarily due to his high salary and the expected transfer fee to sign him.[227] Various media outlets dubbed Neymar as the 'Prince who never became King' due to leaving Europe without a Ballon d'Or and no additional Champions League titles after the 2015 win with Barcelona.[228][229]</p>

            <div class="text11">
            <h1>International career</h1>
            <p>Internationally, Neymar was considered for the Brazilian side that participated in the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, but he was ultimately not included on the squad. Instead, he made his debut for the national team in August 2010, in a friendly match against the U.S., where he scored his first international goal in Brazil’s 2–0 win. He scored four goals for Brazil at the 2013 Confederations Cup, including one in the team’s 3–0 victory over Spain in the final, and won the Golden Ball as the tournament’s most valuable player as well as the Bronze Boot as its third highest scorer. Neymar starred for Brazil when his home country hosted the 2014 World Cup, scoring four goals in five games before he was knocked out of the competition with a fractured vertebra in the quarterfinals. Without the team’s most important player, Brazil lost by a shocking 7–1 margin to eventual-champion Germany in the semifinals. Despite his early exit from the tournament, Neymar won the Bronze Boot. At the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympic Games, he led the Brazilian men’s side to its first Olympic gold medal, scoring the winning penalty in extra time of the final match against Germany.

                Neymar scored two goals at the 2018 World Cup but was as well-known for his many theatrical embellishments of fouls during that tournament (Neymar was the most-fouled player in the event) as for his on-field play. Brazil’s World Cup appearance ended with a quarterfinal loss to Belgium. During the 2022 World Cup, Neymar suffered an ankle injury and was forced to miss several games. In the quarterfinal match against Croatia, he scored his 77th international goal. However, Brazil lost in a penalty shootout.</p>
