            <h1>Schooling</h1>
            <p>Ronaldo was born into a low-income family and consequently never attended school. He was accused of throwing a chair at one of his school instructors when he was 14 years old, for which he was expelled. Ronaldo has loved football since he was a child and aspired to make a career, so he dropped out of school after being expelled. Ronaldo’s family supported him in his decision to drop out.A tall player at 6 feet 1 inch (1.85 meters), Ronaldo was a formidable athlete on the pitch. Originally a right-winger, he developed into a forward with a free-reined attacking style. He was able to mesmerize opponents with a sleight of foot that made sufficient space for openings in opposing defenses.</p>

            <h1>Personal Particulars </h1>
            <p>Cristiano’s stamina, tempo, technique, and expertise have gained him international acclaim.

            <h1>Sporting FC </h1>

According to Cristiano Ronaldo’s agent, clubs such as Barcelona, Liverpool, and Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger expressed interest in signing the great young Portuguese sensation of Sporting FC in the 2002-2003 season.</p>

            <div class="text8">
            <h1>Manchester United </h1>
            <p>In 2003-2004, Cristiano Ronaldo became Manchester United’s first Portuguese player. He requested his Sporting FC number 28, but at Old Trafford, he was assigned the No.7 jersey, which David Beckham and Eric Cantona had previously worn. Cristiano Ronaldo made his Manchester United debut as a substitute for Nicky Butt against Bolton Wonders on August 16, 2003, and United won 4-0. In his first match, Ronaldo earned a standing ovation from the crowd and numerous praises from the United legend George Best. Cristiano Ronaldo’s profession took off in the 2006-07 season when he scored more than 20 goals for Manchester United under Sir Alex Ferguson. He demonstrated his value on the field by assisting the team in winning their first Premier League title in four years.</p>

            <div class="text9">
            <h1>Real Madrid </h1>
            <p>Cristiano Ronaldo decided to join Real Madrid from Manchester United ahead of the 2008-09 season for the highest-ever transfer fee of £80 million. Madrid confirmed a 5-year contract extension with Cristiano Ronaldo through 2015, paying him £11 million per year and including a €1 billion release money, indicating a significant advancement in Cristiano Ronaldo’s career. Ronaldo was given the number 9 jersey in his early days at Real Madrid since Raul was the team captain. Cristiano Ronaldo’s life story changed when he moved from Manchester United to Real Madrid, thanks to his success at the Santiago Bernabeu. He has played 292 games and scored 311 goals in his eight years at Real Madrid.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="text10">
            <h1>Juventus</h1>
            <p>Cristiano departed Real Madrid in 2018 for Juventus for a fee of €100 million plus €12 million in additional expenditures. Ronaldo agreed to a four-year contract with Juventus, and the cost paid by the new team was the highest ever paid for a 30-year-old player. In his fourth game for Juventus, Ronaldo scored his first goal against Sassuolo, and he was sent off for the first time in his 154th Champions League encounter against Valencia.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="text11">
            <h1>International career</h1>
            <p>On his home soil, after moving through the youth and under-21 ranks, Ronaldo had made his first appearance for Portugal’s full national team against Kazakhstan in August 2003 (four days after his debut for United). He was a key player in Portugal’s fourth-place finish at the 2006 World Cup and became the full-time captain of the national team in 2008. In 2012 his stellar play led Portugal to the semifinals of the European Championship, where his team was eliminated by rival Spain in a match that was decided by a penalty kick shoot-out. Ronaldo came into the 2014 World Cup hot off of his second world player of the year win, but his play at the tournament was spotty, and the entire Portugal team struggled during a group-stage elimination. In 2016 he helped Portugal win the European Championship, the country’s first major international tournament title, although he only played sparingly in the final because of a knee injury that he had sustained early in the match. Ronaldo played brilliantly at the 2018 World Cup, scoring four goals in four games as Portugal advanced to the knockout round only to lose its first match of that stage to a strong defensive Uruguay side. Four years later Ronaldo became the first male player to score at five different World Cups. However, he was not part of the starting lineup for several games, and Portugal’s 2022 World Cup ended with a loss in the quarterfinals. </p>
